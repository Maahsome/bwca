## v0.0.0-NEXT

### Additions

#### [Pull Request #5](https://github.com/Maahsome/bwca/pull/5)

- `get folder` - get an individual folder
- `add folder` - create a new folder
**NOTE** (__BUG__): When I used the POST to add a folder, ALL folder/items disappeared from the local copy.  So calls to `get folders` and `get items` returned only the last created folder, and `[ ]` no items.  Which is of course concerning.  A POST to `/sync` refreshed the local copy, which included all the items AND the newly created folder. 

#### [Pull Request #4](https://github.com/Maahsome/bwca/pull/4)

- Added `get folders` support
